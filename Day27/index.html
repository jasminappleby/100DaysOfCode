                The above image is some official art from the game. It can be found inside the games box and also
                inside the Steelbook which came as a preorder material in some regions! I think it is possible one 
                of my favourite Pokémon art pieces. I would happily have this in poster form!

                One of my favourite things about this game is the overexpressions which the characters have
                in cutscenes. They can make for such good meme images. Regardless of the meme quality these
                have, it also just makes the game feel less flat, and gives the characters personality.
